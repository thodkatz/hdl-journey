**Introduction**
This repository includes a set of minor programms during my personal journey of understanding the two major hardware description languages: Verilog and VHDL

**Set up**
For Verilog in GNU/Linux the compiler icarus-verilog should be installed.
In Ubuntu, use the command: sudo apt-get install iverilog.

For VHDL in GNU/Linux the compiler GHDL should be installed. First you need to install the .tar file from http://ghdl.free.fr/download.html, extract it and then set the executable file in the path to run it from any directory.

For both Verilog and VHDL, GTKWave will be used for rendering. It can be install in Ubuntu using the command: sudo apt-get install gtkwave

**Guide/Reference/Inspiration**
The Hardware modeling using Verilog from nptel free-online-courses is the guideline to create the source files based on Verilog. Another resource could be the Reference design tutorialfor verilog, but I don't think it suits the needs! More to come, I guess...

For VDHL the https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese171/vhdl/vhdl_primer.html and http://esd.cs.ucr.edu/labs/tutorial/ are the guidelines to create the source files (quite undefined, because I am now focused mostly on Verilog)

**Notes**
The tutorials that I am going to follow are still work in progress
